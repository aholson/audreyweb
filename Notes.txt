[Hello there!]
My name is Audrey, and I'm an avid lover and aspiring implementer of innovative UI/UX design with a comparable zeal for music, filmography, and the written word. I define myself by the holistic approach I enjoy taking towards the things I build - each of my personal projects is tenderly hand-crafted with full stack familiarity. My perpetual goal as a software engineer (and onlooker into the curio cabinet of life) is the transparentization of any and all black boxes, technical or otherwise.
